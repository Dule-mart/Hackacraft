We help individuals who are trying to get a foothold in tech and are having problems selecting an area of programming they wish to major in and those who need tools to aid your learning.

Hack-a-craft is a nonprofit organization that educates, training, and establish technology hubs within underrepresented communities. Our aim is to increase the number of underrepresented persons in the global workforce, creating an equal learning environment.
