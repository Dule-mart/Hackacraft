# Hackacraft
Hackacraft community website

We help individuals who are trying to get a foothold in tech and are having problems selecting an area of programming they wish to major in and those who need tools to aid your learning.

Hack-a-craft is a nonprofit organization that educates, training, and establish technology hubs within underrepresented communities. Our aim is to increase the number of underrepresented persons in the global workforce, creating an equal learning environment.

This proposal lays out our plan for Project Roadmap and will include an overview of our project as well as the detailed needs and scope of this project. The total estimated funding needed will also be included but could change during the research phase of our project as we learn more about the potential challenges.
We will do our best to win your approval for this project as it's the culmination of 2 years of preliminary observation and thoughts put together. I wrote a publication about it, click here to read.
We sincerely thank you for your thoughtful consideration of our project and will be available to answer any questions you have and clarify anything within this proposal.
